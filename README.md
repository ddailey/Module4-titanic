# Module 4.2 Titanic Code

This mini-project goes with Module 4.2 of the Springboard Introduction to Data Science course. 

The DataCamp project provides the titanic dataset within their course framework and the data is already tidy. 

The final chart allows the viewer to see who survived the sinking of the Titanic, by comparing the variables of Age, Passenger Class, and Sex of each passenger. Your odds of survival were much higher if you were a woman in any class, but most especially if you were in First Class. Children were also more likely to survive than adults. For men, they fared better in First Class (though not as well as First Class women).
